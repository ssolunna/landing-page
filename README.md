# Welcome to my Graphic Designer Portfolio
Hi! My name is Selena Solunna from Panama and I'm an Industrial Engineer who is in the process of becoming a self-taught Web Developer.
I have also done some **graphic designs** for my previous job and an **UI design** as part of my graduation project that will be displayed in this portfolio webpage.
